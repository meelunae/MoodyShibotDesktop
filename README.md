# MoodyShibotDesktop
Desktop version of my Twitch bot. Integrates a bunch of cool features.

Welcome to yet another C# project.

This bot was an attempt to learn how to deal with Windows Forms applications development and I am kinda satisfied with the outcome.

This project adds a few cool features to my bot (thanks BoxboxBot by AterialDawn for inspiration on a lot of those) that in my opinion are obtainable just by using Forms.
 
Here's the list: 

- Music hotkeys (hardcoded, haven't managed to learn a way to read/write config files yet)

- Polls. Ask your chat questions about whatever you want, and whoever gets the answer right earns a defined amount of points while who answers wrong loses that amount!

- Text to speech for the memes

- Way to keep track "decently" of songrequests

And more features might come in the future.

Please, considering that this is one of my first actual projects, feel free to open issues and pull requests so I can make my code better and learn :)
